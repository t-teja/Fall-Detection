# Fall Detection App - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview
An Android application designed to detect falls in elderly people using TinyML (TensorFlow Lite) and foreground services. The app provides continuous monitoring and automatic emergency response to help save lives during medical emergencies or accidents.

## 🏗️ Architecture
- **TinyML Integration**: TensorFlow Lite for on-device fall detection
- **Foreground Service**: Continuous monitoring even when app is in background
- **Sensor Fusion**: Accelerometer, Gyroscope, and Magnetometer data processing
- **Emergency Response**: Automatic alerts to emergency contacts with location
- **Battery Optimized**: Efficient algorithms to preserve device battery

## 📱 Core Features

### 1. Fall Detection Engine
- Real-time sensor data processing
- Machine learning model for fall pattern recognition
- Configurable sensitivity settings
- False positive reduction algorithms

### 2. Emergency Response System
- Automatic SMS and call alerts
- GPS location sharing
- Emergency contact management
- Countdown timer for false positive cancellation

### 3. User Interface
- Elderly-friendly design with large buttons
- Simple navigation and clear status indicators
- Settings management for customization
- Emergency contact configuration

### 4. Background Monitoring
- Foreground service for continuous operation
- Battery optimization compliance
- Auto-start on device boot
- Persistent notification with status
